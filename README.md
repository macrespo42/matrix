# Welcome to the matrix ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’Š

## An introduction to Linear Algebra


All the unit test for the project can be run with `cargo test`  
And you can run a little CLI programm to show test output with `cargo run`

###  <a name="ex00">Exercise 00 - Add, Subtract and Scale</a>

Maximum time complexity: **O(n)**  
Maximum space complexity: **O(n)**

You must write functions that can add and subtract two vectors, or two matrices, of the
same size; and a function to multiply a vector, or a matrix, by a scalar (ie, "scaling").
You must also turn in a main function in order to test your functions, ready to be
compiled (if necessary) and run.

### <a name="ex01">Exercise 01 - Linear combination</a>

Maximum time complexity: **O(n)**  
Maximum space complexity: **O(n)**

You must write a function that computes a linear combination of the vectors provided,
using the corresponding scalar coefficients.
You must also turn in a main function in order to test your function, ready to be
compiled (if necessary) and run.
